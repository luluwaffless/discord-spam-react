# discord spam react
node.js webapp to spam reactions on discord messages, channels, users or guilds (first one on input, the rest when messages are created)
`npm i` to download modules, `node .` or `npm start` to run, opens on `http://localhost` 
make sure to input your account's token on the .env file, **i'm not responsible if it gets banned**
btw atm it has barely any error checks soo don't try to input invalid stuff nor look at it funny cuz it may crash the whole thing lol
